            The prevalence of obesity and stress are continuously rising, and so related diseases such as type II diabetes and cardiovascular diseases have become a big issue for medical care and health systems.

Both conditions can be circumvented by prevention or intervention strategies such as lifestyle programs.1,2 These behavior change programs are based on the concepts of either “life counseling” where participants are trained and supervised by coaches3 or “quantifying self ” where participants use tools to periodically measure their single body conditions.4 However, comprehensive programs combining both concepts are largely missing. Therefore, the sustainability of the achieved results remains a big challenge.

Poor accountability and adherence of individuals are well-known obstacles that account for failure and lacking benefits of preventive and therapeutic lifestyle recommendation programs.5,6 One of the problems here is that participants of such medical programs have only very restricted possibilities to monitor their personal progress during the course of the program either because they are not trained well enough for collecting their personal data indicating their personal progress or due to a lack of a tool to generate numeric or other measurable outcome data. Usually, measurable data are obtained only at the end of the program, such as in weight-reducing programs or diabetes prevention strategies. In order to enhance the accountability and adherence of the clients and patients, it is therefore recommended to conceptualize various performance measures (PMs) that enable them to participate and engage their trainings and treatment plans.7

The Competence Centre for Complementary Medicine and Naturopathy (CoCoNat) located in the Medical Faculty of the Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany, has been developing an applicable approach to measure patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for the needs of clinical and outcomes research, health education, and everyday practice in the field of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), kneippism, and behavioral change programs.

In the last 10 years, CoCoNat has been generating an Individual Health Management (IHM) that enables the individual to care for and optimize his or her own so-called physiological basis functions as well as psychosocial and cognitive basis competences during daily life combining “life counseling” with “personal coaching.”8

The use of organismic, psychosocial as well as cognitive personal contributions to stay healthy is a core issue of salutogenic theory and of many of the folk medicines.

            Health care or healthcare is the improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, amelioration or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people. Health care is delivered by health professionals and allied health fields. Medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, midwifery, nursing, optometry, audiology, psychology, occupational therapy, physical therapy, athletic training, and other health professions all constitute health care. It includes work done in providing primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, as well as in public health.

Access to health care may vary across countries, communities, and individuals, influenced by social and economic conditions as well as health policies. Providing health care services means "the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes".[3] Factors to consider in terms of health care access include financial limitations (such as insurance coverage), geographical and logistical barriers (such as additional transportation costs and the possibility to take paid time off work to use such services), sociocultural expectations, and personal limitations (lack of ability to communicate with health care providers, poor health literacy, low income).[4] Limitations to health care services affects negatively the use of medical services, the efficacy of treatments, and overall outcome (well-being, mortality rates).
